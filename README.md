Building a cookie clicker game on a page
As a user i want to visit the page and see my current number of cookies, i want to be able to buy cookies by pressing a button, i also want to be able to buy upgrades with my available cookies.


1) I was able to meet the requirements of displaying a cookie counter and a cookies per second counter to the user,letting the user click to buy cookies, i was also to display the upgrades available to the user and include some functionality to them - making the upgrades subtract the cost in cookies and updating the stats that the user can see

2) i believe i met the main requirements of the task
